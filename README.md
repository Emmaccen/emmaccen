# Hello there 👋,

My name is Emmanuel Lucius. I am a software engineer with 5+ years of experience 💪 building to-scale web applications using modern technologies such as **ReactJs** (**Typescript** && **NextJs**) for front-facing applications 📱 💻 . 

I am presently functioning in the Crypto 🪙 | Blockchain 🔗 | DeFi 💹 space where I **Document blockchain APIs**, maintain Docs website, code reviews and fixes. I often collaborate on front-facing applications in the DeFi space of Blockchain development ([SmartFi exchange](https://smartfi.com/))

I am comfortable working with CSS frameworks like **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**, and have in-depth knowledge of Component libraries such as **[Antd](https://ant.design/)** and **[Material UI](https://mui.com/)**. I follow great design patterns and best practices that allow me to write code 👨‍💻 that is scalable and manageable. I am comfortable working with APIs and databases.

I have a few OSS contributions from recognised companies and repos like **[meta](https://github.com/facebook)**, **[11ty](https://github.com/11ty/11ty-website)**,  **[next-image-export-optimizer](https://github.com/Niels-IO/next-image-export-optimizer)**, **DDW** etc. Some are as simple as fixing a typo, and others, are good enough to **take the week off** 🌴🏖️

In my free time, I learn more about OOP (C#)  and other frameworks (.Net) to improve 💪 my understanding of OOP, how backend technologies work and how the client-side interacts with data.

I **[create content](https://dev.to/emmaccen)** 📚(Blogging) to keep myself accountable for my learning journey. I engage **[my social feeds](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-lucius-emmaccen/)** with short tutorials on technology and programming. I seldom create compelling designs in Figma 🎨🖌 and it has helped me to improve my eye for aesthetics and design practices.

I have worked on numerous projects such as LMS (Learning Management System), where I functioned on modules (Admin, Student, Teacher, and more) in multiple spaces such as React.js, Angular and NextJs and consumed APIs built with .Net.

I had the opportunity to work on big banking applications such as **[DocStream](https://www.docstream.ng/)** for document 📂 and access management software for **Fidelity Bank**, where I functioned on parts of the customer, admin, and enterprise modules.

I also had the privilege to collaborate on Automated systems projects **([Mail automation](https://maildrip.io/)** 📬, internal accessibility systems, etc.) for internal and external company products as well as **e-commerce** and **Magazine websites** for a multinational company **([the famous ddw](https://www.dontdiewondering.com/))**


I am familiar (and worked) with project management tools like **[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)**, **[Trello](https://trello.com/home)**, **[Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/)** and **Microsoft Teams**.

Currently ⌚, I am **learning Rust 🦀** (To secure my future in blockchain technology) and enhancing my knowledge of **Algorithms and Data structures** 🧠💪 (I started my journey with **Java** 👴) to boost my problem-solving skills 🛠. I am open to learning new things 🌍, a team player, and ready to grow at all times 💯 .

Thanks for **checking out my profile**, it’s a **pleasure to meet you** 🤝.
