### Hello there 👋,

My name is Emmanuel Lucius. I am a professional web developer with **4+ years of experience** 💪 building to scale web applications using modern technologies such as **ReactJs** (In Typescript and NextJs) for front-facing applications 📱 💻 .

I have good knowledge of Component libraries like **Antd** (ant design) and Material UI (Still strengthening my foot in this 😇). I follow great design patterns and best practices that allow me to write code 👨‍💻 that's easily manageable and scalable. I'm comfortable working with APIs and databases.

In my free time, I learn **OOP** and other frameworks (C# && .Net) which has helped me to solidify 💪 my knowledge of how backend technologies work and how the client-side interacts with data.

[I create content](https://dev.to/emmaccen) 📚(Blogging) to keep myself accountable for my learning journey and I engage [my social feeds](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-lucius-emmaccen/) with short tutorials on technology and programming. I also create compelling **designs in Figma** 🎨🖌 and it has helped me to improve my eye for aesthetics and design practices.

I've worked on numerous projects such as **LMS** (Learning Management System), where I functioned on different modules (Admin, Student, Teacher, etc.) in **ReactJs** and consumed data via APIs built with **.Net**.

I’ve also had the opportunity to work on huge banking applications such as “DocStream”, which is a document 📂 and access management software for **Fidelity Bank**, where I functioned on parts of the customer, admin, and enterprise modules.

I've had the privilege to collaborate on Automated systems projects ([Mail automation](https://maildrip.io/) 📬, internal accessibility systems, etc.) for internal and external company products, amongst others such as e-commerce, [the famous ddw](https://www.dontdiewondering.com/) and many more.

I'm familiar (and worked) with project management tools like [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) ("[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and confluence", "[Trello](https://trello.com/home)") and "Microsoft teams".

Currently ⌚, I'm enhancing my knowledge of Algorithms and Data structures 🧠💪 (I started my journey with Java 👴) to boost my problem-solving skills 🛠. I'm always open to learning new things 🌍, a team player, and ready to grow at all times 💯 .

Thanks for checking out my profile, it’s a pleasure to meet you 🤝.
